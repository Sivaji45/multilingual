In the ancient land of Ayodhya, Prince Rama, alongside his wife Sita and loyal brother Lakshmana, faced exile to the forest. Sita was abducted by the demon king Ravana, leading to a fierce battle where Rama, aided by the monkey warrior Hanuman and his army, defeated Ravana and rescued Sita. Upon their return to Ayodhya, Rama was crowned king, embodying righteousness and honor. His reign ushered in an era of peace and prosperity, known as Ram Rajya. The epic tale of the Ramayana teaches lessons of duty, devotion, and the triumph of good over evil, inspiring generations with its timeless wisdom.
